# The GuessingStrategy module contains methods for intelligent guessing in the Battleship game.
# It helps the computer player make educated guesses based on previous hits.

module GuessingStrategy
  # Initializes the strategy with necessary attributes for intelligent guessing.
  # QD - Keeps track of recent hits to target adjacent cells for better accuracy.
  # JB - Helps maintain a list of cells to prioritize based on hit patterns.

    @hit_tracking = []       # Stores coordinates of recent hits to target adjacent cells.
    @target_queue = []       # Queue of coordinates to guess after a hit.
  end

  # Decides the next cell to fire upon based on hit tracking.
  # QD - Uses hit data to determine strategic moves, prioritizing adjacent cells.
  # JB - Allows the computer to pursue a hit sequence rather than random firing.

# Updates the strategy based on the result of a shot.
# QD - If a hit, adds adjacent cells to the target queue for the next moves.
# JB - Ensures a ship is fully hit by tracking nearby cells until it's sunk.
