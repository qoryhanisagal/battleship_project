**Message:**  
In Iteration 1, "Ship" is complete and "Cell" has been started. `place_ship` and `fire_upon` have been updated with lib/spec files. 

Started the `render` process but got stuck!

Began Board class/spec. I noticed my Iteration 1 is slightly off, not sure what issues that might cause to merge with main.

Worked up to `valid_placement?` method creation, stopped and paused here (3pm ET). RSpec board file should be good to go, but lib file has not been updated so tests aren't all passing (yet!). 

Planning to return to it tonight!
