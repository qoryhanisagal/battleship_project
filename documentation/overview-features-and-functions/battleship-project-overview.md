# Battleship Project Overview

## Team Members:
- Jillian
- Qory

## Game Objective:
Create a playable version of Battleship using a REPL interface. The game will feature a single human player playing against a computer player.

## Game Setup:
- Both the human player and the computer will have a 4x4 board.
- Each player will have two ships:
  - Cruiser (3 cells)
  - Submarine (2 cells)

## Gameplay:
- Players take turns firing shots at the opponent’s board.
- The board will indicate hits (H), misses (M), and sunken ships (X).

## End Condition:
The game is won when either the player or the computer sinks both enemy ships.

## Evaluation Rubric

### Functionality:
- **Exceeds Expectations**: 2 of the features in Iteration 4 are complete.
- **Meets Expectations**: All of the functionality in Iteration 3 is complete.
- **Approaching Expectations**: Some functionality in Iteration 3 is incomplete.
- **Below Expectations**: Game cannot execute ship placement or Iteration 2 is incomplete.

### Object-Oriented Programming:
- **Exceeds Expectations**: Project includes at least one additional class that adheres to SRP and acts as a crucial piece in the function of the program.
- **Meets Expectations**: Project includes at least one additional class, and the correct number of Board, Cell, and Ship objects are created. Most code is contained within classes.
- **Approaching Expectations**: Project includes an additional class, but object creation may be unnecessary or incomplete.
- **Below Expectations**: Project does not include a class not outlined in the spec or fails to use objects appropriately.

### Test-Driven Development:
- **Exceeds Expectations**: Includes an additional test file that fully tests a class.
- **Meets Expectations**: No more than 2 tests fail to verify expected behavior. Most methods are unit/integration tested.
- **Approaching Expectations**: More than 2 tests fail, or certain methods are not tested.
- **Below Expectations**: Half the methods are not tested or do not accurately verify behavior.

### Version Control:
- **Exceeds Expectations**: Project includes at least 10 pull requests with comments and 30 commits. Balanced contribution between partners.
- **Meets Expectations**: Project includes at least 10 pull requests and 30 commits.
- **Approaching Expectations**: Project includes fewer pull requests or commits.
- **Below Expectations**: Less than 20 commits or 5 pull requests.

### Presentation & Professional Development:
- **Exceeds Expectations**: All reflection questions answered thoughtfully with suggestions for future improvements.
- **Meets Expectations**: All questions are answered thoughtfully.
- **Approaching Expectations**: 1 reflection or presentation point is not thoughtfully answered.
- **Below Expectations**: More than 1 reflection question is skipped or not answered thoughtfully.

## Written Reflection:

### Questions:
1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you would’ve approached the design and problem-solving process.
2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

## Presentation Points:

### Demonstration of Functional Completeness:
- Run the `runner.rb` file and demonstrate gameplay in the terminal.
- Highlight edge case handling in the demonstration.

### Technical Quality & Organization of Code:
- Describe how the game was structured. What classes were created? Explain the responsibility of each class.
- Highlight a design decision that you are particularly proud of.

### Code Refactoring:
- Identify a section of code that you’d like to refactor and explain how you’d improve it.
- Address any uncertainties about specific parts of your code.

### Test Coverage:
- Provide examples of unit and integration tests.
- Run your test suite and open a coverage report (e.g., SimpleCov if implemented).

### Pairing & Version Control:
- Describe the pairing technique used.
- Review GitHub insights: how many pull requests, commits, and how balanced the contributions were.
- Highlight a PR that demonstrates good commenting and partner review workflow.
