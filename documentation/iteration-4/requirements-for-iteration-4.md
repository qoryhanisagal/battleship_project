# Requirements for Iteration 4: Additional Features

---

## New Classes for Iteration 4

### 1. **Board Class (Extended for Variable Board Size)**
- **Purpose**: Allows for custom board sizes to be set at the beginning of the game, and adjusts validations (ship placement, firing) to account for the variable board dimensions.
- **New Methods**:
  - `set_board_size`: Allows the user to input custom height and width for the game board.
  - `valid_coordinate?`: Ensures that coordinates provided fit within the custom board size.
  
### 2. **Ship Class (Extended for Custom Ships)**
- **Purpose**: Allows players to create ships with custom names and lengths during the setup phase.
- **New Methods**:
  - `initialize_custom_ship`: Takes user input for the ship name and length and creates a custom ship.
  
### 3. **Computer Class (Enhanced for Intelligent Targeting)**
- **Purpose**: Provides more strategic firing by the computer opponent, using logic based on previous hits and misses.
- **New Methods**:
  - `intelligent_fire`: Makes educated guesses on which coordinates to fire based on previous results.

## Spec Files for Iteration 4

### 1. **Board Spec**
- **Tests to Implement**:
  - Tests for handling variable board sizes, ensuring that the correct dimensions are set and all board functionality works as expected.
  - Ensure that ship placement and coordinate validations function correctly with various board sizes.

### 2. **Ship Spec**
- **Tests to Implement**:
  - Tests for handling custom ships, ensuring players can create ships with custom names and lengths.
  - Ensure that custom ships interact with the board correctly (e.g., hit detection, sinking).

### 3. **Computer Spec**
- **Tests to Implement**:
  - Ensure the computerâ€™s intelligent firing logic works as expected, choosing strategic coordinates based on previous hits and misses.
  - Test that the computer does not repeat shots on the same cell unless it's part of the strategic targeting.
