# Battleship Project

## Project Overview
Prepare to engage in the ultimate strategic showdown with our Ruby-based Battleship game! Face off against a cunning computer opponent in a battle of wits, precision, and firepower. Command your fleet, anticipate your enemy’s next move, and fire your way to victory on the high seas!

This isn't just any Battleship game—it's built with strategy, personalization, and unpredictability in mind. Each game will challenge your tactical thinking and keep you on your toes, making every shot count. With additional features like **Ship Customization**, **Timed Rounds**, and **Fog of War**, you’ll never face the same battle twice. Ready your fleet—victory awaits!

## Game Features:
- **4x4 grid** for both human and computer players—strategize your ship placements!
- **Two iconic ships** per player:
  - **Cruiser** (3 cells)
  - **Submarine** (2 cells)
- **Turn-based gameplay**: Can you sink the opponent's ships before they sink yours?
- **Dynamic computer opponent**: With randomized moves and strategic behavior, the AI is always one step ahead—can you outsmart it?

## What Makes Our Battleship Unique:
- **Ship Customization**: Personalize your fleet! Name and configure your ships to suit your playstyle.
- **Ship Abilities**: Activate special powers! Ships like the Submarine can "dive" to avoid attacks or the Cruiser can fire double shots for maximum damage.
- **Battle History and Stats**: Track every move you make. With detailed stats, you can analyze your victories (or defeats) and improve your tactics game after game.
- **Fog of War**: Not everything is as it seems. Fog covers the board, hiding parts of your opponent’s fleet until you reveal them with precision strikes.
- **Timed Rounds**: Feel the pressure as the clock ticks down. Plan your moves quickly but carefully before your time runs out.
- **Achievements and Rewards**: Earn badges of honor! Conquer specific challenges, from winning multiple games in a row to sinking enemy ships with pinpoint accuracy.

## Why You’ll Love This Game:
Our Battleship game is not just about luck—it’s about strategy, anticipation, and tactical prowess. Whether you're a seasoned strategist or new to naval warfare, every round will bring a fresh challenge. With randomized ship placements and dynamic AI behavior, no two games are alike. 

Set sail on an unforgettable adventure and see if you have what it takes to sink your opponent’s fleet before they sink yours. Plus, with **personalized ships**, **strategic abilities**, and **hidden surprises**, this game takes the classic Battleship experience to a whole new level.
